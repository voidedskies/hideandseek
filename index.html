            <h1>Hide and Seek</h1>
            <p>You have been challenged to a game of hide and seek by an entity. It has given you a very short amount of time to find a hiding spot. There are severe consequences if it finds you and you don’t feel like finding out what these consequences could be. You feel like this creature may be using some trickery to determine whether or not you will be found.</p>
            <p>You look around the place you are standing to find an adequate place to hide. You take note of two rooms, the kitchen and the bedroom. You also consider finding a way to escape but there are no doors in sight.</p>
            <p>Where would you like to hide?</p>

            <h2>The Kitchen</h2>
            <p>You enter the kitchen. You start looking around but take notice of only two places, the cupboard and the fridge.</p>
            <p>The cupboard is under the countertop near the sink. From the outside it looks like it could easily fit a bunch of pots, pans and other large kitchen items so you figure that you could easily fit in there.</p>
            <p>The fridge is moderately sized and tucked away next to the wall. You stand next to it to get a gauge of your height next to it. You figure that as long as the shelves are removable you could fit in here.</p>

        <p>You hold as still as possible hoping that the entity leaves soon. You close your eyes for a while and then you open them. You shift slightly trying to see if there’s any cracks in the cupboard where you could peer out to see if you are safe to leave. You feel that the coast might be clear but you don’t dare to open the cupboard until you know for certain that it has left.</p>
        <p>Suddenly the entity rips the door off of its hinges. It grabs you out of your hiding spot and says “<em>I win.</em>”</p>

        <p>You climb your way outside of the cupboard and stand up to look around. You notice a door. You didn’t see a door there before. You approach the door and open it.</p>
        <p>It is pretty outside the door. It’s almost as if it leads you to a different dimension. It was freedom compared to this hellish game of hide and seek. You choose to go into the door and close it behind you. You are free.</p>

        <p>Shortly after you hear footsteps approach a cupboard and pause for a moment. You hear the creature rip the cupboard door off its hinges and throw it to the ground. There are a few more footsteps, you can hear the entity breathe angrily. After a few more moments it leaves and the world around you is silent. 
        </p>
        <p>“<em>You win</em>” it says, its shrill voice feels like it’s right in your ears.</p>
        <p>You push at the fridge door to release yourself from your hiding spot but the door doesn’t budge. You slowly suffocate. Didn’t you hear the PSAs about hiding in fridges?</p>
